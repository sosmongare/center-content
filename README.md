# Centering Contents Both Horizontally and Vertically

This repository contains an example code snippet that demonstrates how to center contents both horizontally and vertically on a webpage using Bootstrap and additional CSS properties.

## Description

Centering content on a webpage is a common requirement in web design. This code snippet provides a practical solution to achieve horizontal and vertical centering using Bootstrap's responsive framework and some custom CSS.

The code utilizes the flexbox properties provided by Bootstrap to create a container that horizontally and vertically centers its contents. It also includes CSS classes for the card element and image to ensure proper alignment and sizing.

## Usage

To use this code in your project, follow these steps:

1. Include the Bootstrap CSS file in your HTML document. You can use the following CDN link:
   ```
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/css/bootstrap.min.css">
   ```

2. Copy the HTML code provided in the `index.html` file of this repository and paste it into your own HTML file.

3. Customize the content within the card to match your requirements. Update the profile picture, name, bio, and any other relevant information.

4. Adjust the CSS styles if needed. The provided CSS classes (`container`, `card`, and `card-img-top`) can be modified to suit your specific layout preferences.

5. Test the page in your web browser to ensure that the content is centered both horizontally and vertically.
